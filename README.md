Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

Dependencies
cmake >= v3.5
make >= v4.1
gcc/g++ >= v5.4
Basic Build Instructions
Clone this repo.
Make a build directory: mkdir build && cd build
Compile: cmake .. && make
Run it: ./UnscentedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt. You can find some sample inputs in 'data/'.
eg. ./UnscentedKF ../data/obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt
Editor Settings
We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend using the following settings:

indent using spaces
set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)
Code Style
Please stick to Google's C++ style guide as much as possible.

Generating Additional Data
This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the utilities repo for Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
